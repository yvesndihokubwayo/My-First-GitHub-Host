	<p style="font-size: 30px;font-family:inherit; text-align: justify; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;"> Every individual has a reason why he or she wakes up in the morning. My dream is to become one of the Savvy Tech People through being a Website Designer. With the help of the Web Development and Programming Course, I believe that I can pursue my dreams of being proactive when I am always attentive whenever my instructor is teaching and don't hesitate to ask him for more clarifications in case there is something I don't understand throughout the course. Therefore, at the end of my diploma years, I confide in what I currently learn that I will have been enabled to competitively create a website. Thus, my dream will haven been attained. </p>
